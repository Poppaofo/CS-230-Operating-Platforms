The Gaming Room (Draw it or Lose it)

 For this project, I worked as a Technology Consultant for The Gaming Room. The gaming room wanted to be able to have their game "Draw it or Lose it" to be able to function on multiple platforms. This game is where teams compete to solve a puzzle while the application renders images from a library of stock drawings as clues. If the team does not guess the correct answer before the 30 seconds is up, then the other team can guess and steal from the other team.
 
 What I feel that I did well on is giving the gaming room a clear and detailed report on the Pros and cons of each OS. I think I gave a lot of detail and broke down the categories in a way to make it more time-efficient and easy to read. I also put a lot of thought into who my client was and put their needs and the cost of each OS into consideration when choosing what I thought was the better of the choices. I found that using a design document helped me better understand the idea behind the project. Having a better idea of the project helped me understand and guide me in the right direction to make the changes that were needed to the code.
 
 Although I think I did a fairly good job with the recommendation section of the document, I feel that I would go back and revise that section if I could. The more you learn about each OS the more you start to become curious about them all. For instance, I could have put more information about Windows and the built-in features that Windows has to offer. When making software for a client it is extremely important to understand their needs, If the client's needs are not met then we are not doing our job, which is to make sure that the clients are happy. However, I believe that being a designer it is also our job to give them the options that are available to make it more likely to work well for them and be cost-efficient.
 
 The biggest thing I would take away from this would be to have a complete understanding of what is being asked before you try to make changes. Having a complete understanding of the thing that the client wants will help you have a clear path to get what the client wants, making both you and the client happy. I also make sure to make sure to double-check everything, especially during the coding process. One small mistake could lead to hours of frustration. Always double-check!
